## Summary
In the second exercise of Andy Sterkowitz' Software Development Mastermind Program, I was given the task of creating a hotel booking form application.
It required me to learn all about HTML forms and HTML/browser Form validation.
I also learned more about CSS, namely flexbox and layouts.
